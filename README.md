### About
This was our first project building our own backend from scratch using Node.js and Express.js. We used knex.js along with PostgreSQL to design a schema and set up a database, with a simple jQuery front-end that connects to the backend/database. The backend stores submitted URLS, and includes a shortening function to shorten the URL and save that shortened URL to the corresponding submitted long URL. When clicking the shortened URL, it should hit an endpoint on the backend that will redirect to the original long URL.
